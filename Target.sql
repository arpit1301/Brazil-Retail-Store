-- 1.Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset:

-- Data type of all columns in the "customers" table.

SELECT *
FROM `Target.customers`;

-- Get the time range between which the orders were placed.

SELECT
	MIN(order_purchase_timestamp) AS end_order_date, 
	MAX(order_purchase_timestamp) AS start_order_date
FROM `Target.orders` ;

-- Count the Cities & States of customers who ordered during the given period.

	customer_state

JOIN `Target.orders` AS o
